# 🛡️ Endpoint Suspicious File Scanner

A simple Python tool to scan directories for potentially malicious files based on known dangerous extensions. This tool simulates basic endpoint protection behavior and generates a scan log for further review.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
endpoint_scanner/
├── scanner.py              ← Main Python script
├── suspicious_folder/      ← Sample directory to scan
│   ├── harmless.txt
│   ├── autorun.bat
│   └── virus.exe
├── suspicious.log          ← Auto-generated scan results
└── README.md               ← Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Features

- Scans for suspicious file types: `.exe`, `.bat`, `.vbs`, `.js`, `.scr`
- Recursively walks through target directory
- Logs all findings with timestamps to a file (`suspicious.log`)
- Uses basic Python (no external libraries)

## ✅ How It Works

1. The script walks through a target folder.
2. It checks each file extension.
3. If a file is deemed suspicious, it is logged in the `suspicious.log` file with a timestamp.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Put files to be scanned inside the `suspicious_folder/`.
3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python scanner.py
```

4. Check the results in the terminal and in `suspicious.log`.

## 🔍 Sample Output

```bash
🔍 Scanning for suspicious files...

🚨 Suspicious file found: suspicious_folder/virus.exe
🚨 Suspicious file found: suspicious_folder/autorun.bat

✅ Scan completed. Check suspicious.log for results.
```
